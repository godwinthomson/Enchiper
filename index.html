    <h1>Why do I want to learn HTML?</h1>
    <p>Learning HTML is essential because it forms the backbone of every webpage on the internet. Whether it is a simple website or a complex web application, HTML provides the structure that holds all the content together. By understanding HTML, I can clearly see how websites are built from the ground up and gain a strong foundation before moving on to more advanced web technologies.</p>

<p>Another reason I want to learn HTML is that it opens the door to creativity and practical problem-solving. With even basic HTML knowledge, I can design simple pages, format content, and create layouts that reflect my own ideas. It allows me to turn concepts into real, visible results on a screen. This hands-on creation process is both motivating and rewarding, especially as I improve and explore new features.</p>

<p>Finally, learning HTML is important for my future growth in the digital world. Many careers today—from web development and UI/UX design to digital marketing—require at least a basic understanding of how websites function. Knowing HTML helps me communicate better with developers, customize online content, and build my own projects. It is a skill that not only enhances my technical abilities but also supports long-term learning in the broader field of web development.</p>
