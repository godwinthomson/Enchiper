                    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized around a single, central idea. All sentences within the paragraph must relate to and support this main point, which is often expressed in a topic sentence. This thematic unity helps the reader follow the flow of the argument or description, as paragraphs indicate where new subdivisions of an essay or other writing begin and end. For example, a paragraph describing the unique geology of Pamukkale, Turkey, would include details about its mineral-water-filled calcite travertines</p>

                <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized around a single, central idea. All sentences within the paragraph must relate to and support this main point, which is often expressed in a topic sentence. This thematic unity helps the reader follow the flow of the argument or description, as paragraphs indicate where new subdivisions of an essay or other writing begin and end. For example, a paragraph describing the unique geology of Pamukkale, Turkey, would include details about its mineral-water-filled calcite travertines and the threats posed by tourism, but would avoid discussing the entirely separate topic of the Great Pyramids. Ultimately, a well-constructed paragraph develops one idea at a time, providing enough detail and examples to fully flesh out its specific point.</p>
